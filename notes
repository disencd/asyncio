Async/Await 
	Protocol
	Iterator protocol - __await__, __aiter__, __anext__

Framework

OS -> Python Interpreter –> Asyn FW -> Application FW [Django/Flask]

Twisted & Tornado 
	Twisted – mother of async in python
	
	Tornado – Can/Will run on top of aync

Curio/Trio
	Makes Async easier to propose

	Not mainstream

Asyncio Basics
a.	Low level API
b.	Async / wait – high level
c.	Here to stay
d.	Run eventloop

Low level API
•	Call backs
•	Transport & protocol
•	Network/Sub process & Signals

High Level API – Async Await
•	Run coroutines
•	Stream/Sockets, sub process locks, & timeouts	
	
Mainstream
	Stable & Forever supported
	HTTP – aiohttp & Sanic
	DBS - aiolibs

	Event Loop
o	Integrate with FW
o	Uvloop – makes asyncio – 2-4 times faster
o	Rust meets Python	
o	Safety and performance
o	Incomplete n experimental

Real Tutorial
	
	Makes code go fast
	Multiple Thread – Line of execution, GIL[mutex] prevents multi core concurrency [share CPU]

	Async Program – No OS intervention, 1 process, 1 thread

	
The event loop provides quite a few features to you:

    Register, execute, and cancel delayed calls (asynchronous functions)
    Create client and server transports for communication
    Create subprocesses and transports for communication with another program
    Delegate function calls to a pool of threads

	
==================================================
import asyncio

async def speak_async():
    print('OMG asynchronicity!')

'''
default event loop (asyncio.get_event_loop()), scheduling
and running the async task, and then closing the loop when
the loop is done running.
'''
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

'''
The loop.run_until_complete() function is actually blocking, so it won't
return until all of the asynchronous methods are done.
Since we're only running this on a single thread, there is no way
it can move forward while the loop is in progress.
'''
loop.run_until_complete(speak_async())
loop.close()

#Error -eg1.py:10: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'speak_async' was never awaited
